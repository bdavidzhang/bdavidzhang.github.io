# testimony on speaking and singing 
June 30, 2025

It so happend that I have a fear of speaking too much on a given day, 
so when approached with the task of singing worship after church service,
and then teaching that very same night, I naturally felt strongly reluctant. 

But God strengthened my heart and gave me courage 
to sing that day before the congregation
young and old and so I sang
and my throat did not ache or give in.
This was done for God's glory to be revealed and to be preserved 
as a testimony.
