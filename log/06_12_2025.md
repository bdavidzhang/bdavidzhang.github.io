What is the best format to 
hold onto plans?

This is not the easiest question.
Is it markdown?
Or is it some more structred format,
like a json or a .toml?

Or is it an entire database?

Regarless, making plans help
keep track of things and make 
expectations.

## 📝 Notes
- **Gratitude:** 
  - thankful for lunch, food was great
  - Praise God for letting me be able to work on interesting things
  - thankful for my parents for keeping me alive
  - thankful that I get to watch the NBA despite the loss
  - thankful for making me feel better towards anna after seeing the pictures, it's been a year
- **Challenges:** 
  - Could not get the pytorch transformer to run on colab or gpu, always running into random errors
  - tried out autoGPT but couldn't get it to run, slightly frustrated
  - Neither Google, OpenAI, or anthropic support their apis in China. This is troublesome
  - I thought maybe I could code up pantry-pal as a side kick for now, but the question is how?
  - I need to find some Chinese aleternative.
    - Going to use Ali Cloud
    - Needing Chinse phone #, so not working rn, will need to wait till I'm home
  - 
- **Ideas:** 
  - Trae is actually pretty good
