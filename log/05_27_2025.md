Today I leave SF to head back to China, flight at SFO leaves at 11:30 PM PT, and arrives at Seoul in 12 hours, so maybe around 11:30 AM PT the next day. I know that I will be back in Shenyang by 9:00 AM on May 29, and in the meantime flying will consume a day, yum. 

I want to think about what to do in the meantime. The idea of putting together all of my personal writings make sense. They are mostly publically accessible, but scattered across different corners of the internet. Many of these logs exist to help me flesh (flush) out ideas in my head, but perhaps are not really meant to be read or studied. That's ok, because LLMs possess the skill to analyze text better than humans. 

Perhaps I can expect some degree of fine tuning in the future?

Where should I find all the data I've written?
- google docs
  - diary 
  - essays
  - poetry
  - written assignments, etc. 
- latex 
  - math
  - physics
  - cs 
  - mostly located on my computer, some on overleaf
- markdowns 
  - mostly in this directory,
  - some in stackedit
  - some in notion. 
  - the annyoying thing is that it's hard to get those files, I'll have to manually downlaod or figure out a way to scrape everything. 
- handwritten 
  - various notebooks over the years
  - most lost and unrecoverale

Ok, cool idea - I could let AI write up a wikipedia personal page, no bias. Like what would AI write about me, or describe me? This will take us a step closer to personal agents, IMO. 

Also, maybe it's time to write more about robo-humanity. I had a conversation last night with Ian on this subject:
many people are talking about AGI 2027, *why* AGI, and *how* will it change our lives? 
I want to think about it from the results, there are four possibilities: 
1. we reach the ["singularity"](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613184827/http://yudkowsky.net/singularity.html). (I rememebr reading this back in late march/early april 2023 and becoming contemplelative about the future. Certain detours have since happened, but I am now back on track). In this case, it is highly possible that AGI will solve all the problems we have, and proceed to solve us as a problem. This is popular because of how many times it's been portrayed in sci-fi. 

2. AGI proceeds to help out human beings like never before. All thinkable problems are solved. Life is like Utopia. [JMK is right](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/upload/Intro_and_Section_I.pdf)

3. The singularity never arrives, but we proceed anyway. Maybe the G in AI was never meant for general, but for God, for goodness, for "共同的". AI will become great tools, as they have already been, and we will live in a society of robo-humanity. Like Iron Man and Jarvis. 

4. 2025 is the peak of AI. Technologies proceed to platueau. Most researchers that swarmed into the field with expectancy will leave in disappointment. The field will remain quiet and untouched, just like the way it began. "A family cursed to 100 years of solitude does not deserve a chance for redemption."

Personally, I think 3 is the most likely outcome. Instead of thinking how AI will solve all our problems, I'd like to think how we can solve problems with AI. You never need to wait for that, just start right now.

Good thing I understand Chinese. 



-------------------
Learning react native

Ok, so I've been able to clone the website into a github repo. Success. 

To run the documentation site, I can run 
```bash
yarn --cwx website start
```
where the --cwx flag means to create the website. 

To make sure it runs, I need to open google chrome. Sadly arc cannot be recognized as the running broser. 

The sites of interest are
1. the landing page
2. The detailed documentation given under "components-and-apis"

It would also be cool to figure out how the actual website worked. I don't see any internal html files, but it seems like there's some conversion going on. 


------------------------------
*to Ian*
The lecture was good, 
I may need to head out a bit ealier to grab some food, maybe I might leave in 10 mins and grab some food? Maybe meet you at the door (here) or Wilbur?

-------------------------------
cs336 did a deeper dive on GRPO, 
sadly, I didn't understand most of it because I was kinda falling asleep. LOL. 

A few motivating ideas: 
- state $s$: prompt + previous actions 
- action $a$: generate a new response 
we can see this as a stochastic process where the former state transitions to the next. 

- reward $R(s,a)$: is the reward based on results, this can be: 
1. procedural (do you have CoT)? 
2. verifiable (is the number correct)?
- policy $\pi(a \mid S)$: is the probability distirbution for selecting the next steps givin the current state 

we are interested in optimizing  
$$\mathbb{E}[R(s,a)] = \int \rho(s) \pi(a \mid s) R(s,a)$$
Using gradient methods, 
$$\nabla \mathbb{E}[R(s,a)] = \int \rho(s) \nabla \pi(a \mid s) R(s,a)$$
$$\nabla \mathbb{E}[R(s,a)] = \int \rho(s) \pi(a\mid s) \nabla \log{\pi(a \mid s)} R(s,a)$$
which we can then write as 
$$\nabla \mathbb{E}[R(s,a)] =\mathbb{E}[\log{\pi(a\mid s)} R(s,a)]$$.

Don't really remember how to roll from here, but I will figure it out. I will eventually finish this course. 


------------------------------
Ok, what to do next? I am leaving for the airport soon. 

------------------------------
Ok, I am on the airplane now and it semems like today is approaching the end. Good. Let's see what do I still need to get done in the next couple of hours?? 



How am I going to spend the next ... 30 hours? 
- [x] I am going to sleep for some time on the plane to mitigate jetlag 
- [x] Going to partner with the Holy Spirit to see how He will lead me. 
- [ ] Learn more about app development because it is a relevant and important skill
- [x] figure out how to build a mechanical keyboard, so that I can order the pieces and start building with Jonathan as soon as I get back
- [ ] talk with mr. Yang about the summer camp (once I'm back in China)
- [ ] finish hw 1 for cs 374
- [x] attend the final lecture for cs 336
- [x] leave it to God.

Ok, so in terms of ordering, I'm going to finish hw1 first because it's the easiest, and then probably work on some react skills. I can't really talk to mr. yang because I don't have signal. Sleep will happen naturally, in fact, I'm already really sleepy..., but I may want to hold it for a few more hours. It helps that I went to bed later last night. 

------------------------------

I'm not feeling so well. Dear Lord, please help me. You are my strength and my shield,my repliance

------------------------------ 
Much beter now. I was able to sleep for around 7 hours, so also not really feeling the jetlag too much. 
Thank you Lord. 

Going to lock in.
