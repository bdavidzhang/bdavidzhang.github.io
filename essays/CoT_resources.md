## Reinforcement Learning Advances in CoT Reasoning

### 1.  OpenAI o1 Model (2024)

The o1 model represents a breakthrough in RL-trained reasoning systems, achieving top-tier performance in mathematical and scientific reasoning through:

-   **Automated chain refinement**: The model learns to iteratively improve reasoning paths using RL without human feedback[1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)
    
-   **Scalable training**: Performance improves linearly with both training compute and test-time thinking duration[1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)
    
-   **Safety integration**: RL enables explicit safety rule reasoning within CoT traces, showing 30% fewer jailbreak vulnerabilities compared to previous models[1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)
    

### 2.  Satori Framework (2025)

Introduces  **Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT)**  with three meta-actions:

-   **<|continue|>**: Extends current reasoning trajectory
    
-   **<|reflect|>**: Verifies prior steps' correctness
    
-   **<|explore|>**: Initiates alternative solution paths  
    The system uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with restart-and-explore strategies, achieving 45% error reduction on MATH benchmark compared to standard CoT[6](https://satori-reasoning.github.io/blog/satori/)
    

### 3.  LM-Guided CoT (2024)

Proposes a novel  **teacher-student RL framework**:

-   1B-parameter SLM generates reasoning chains
    
-   Frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4) evaluates and provides rewards
    
-   Combines knowledge distillation with RL from dual reward signals (rationale quality + answer accuracy)  
    Achieves 78.3% F1 on HotpotQA using only 10% of LLM compute


## Small Language Model Implementations

### 1.  EffiChainQA (2024)

Implements CoT in SLMs through:

-   **Retrieval-augmented decomposition**: Breaks questions into sub-problems solvable by specialized SLMs
    
-   **ChatGPT-generated training data**: Creates 500K synthetic reasoning chains for SLM fine-tuning  
    Outperforms standard CoT by 12% on HotpotQA while using 100x fewer parameters[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4218/etrij.2023-0355)
    

### 2.  Instruction-Tuning CoT (2024)

Develops parameter-efficient alignment between LLMs and SLMs:

-   Distills CoT capabilities from 175B GPT-3 to 7B LLaMA through contrastive learning
    
-   Maintains 92% of original reasoning performance with 25x parameter reduction
    
-   Enables zero-shot transfer to unseen domains through modular attention mechanisms[4](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.109/)[7](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.109.pdf)
    

### 3.  Causal Mediation Analysis (2024)

Reveals critical insights for SLM training:

-   RLHF-trained models show 40% weaker CoT faithfulness than instruction-tuned counterparts
    
-   Targeted intervention on specific reasoning steps improves SLM accuracy by 18% on causal reasoning tasks[3](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.882.pdf)
    

**Key Trends**: Recent works emphasize  **automated RL training pipelines**,  **modular reasoning architectures**, and  **efficient knowledge distillation**. The field is moving toward hybrid systems where SLMs handle routine reasoning while dynamically consulting LLMs for complex substeps, achieving both performance and efficiency[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03414)[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4218/etrij.2023-0355).  Current challenges include maintaining reasoning faithfulness in compressed models and developing universal reward functions for multi-step reasoning evaluation[3](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.882.pdf)[6](https://satori-reasoning.github.io/blog/satori/).
