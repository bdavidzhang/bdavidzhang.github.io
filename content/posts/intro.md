A frog sitting beneth the well,\
feet on the earth, eyes perring high.\
"Sunshine, air, freedom--I tried."\
Ribids the frog as he sighs.\
But the well is too deep,\
the walls too high.

So the tiny frog sat in the well,\
Days passed and seasons flew by.\
Spring was the dew that ripened in summer,\
Greenery, bees, and throbbing life.\
Brow was the color of the autum leaves,\
That winter took from the barren trees.

River of time spared not the silent well,\
Hand of age turned the frog a new page.\
Much he desired, to soar and fly--\
and thinking so, he leaped\
his mind taking afar:

A cloud breezing through the sky,\
Drifting aimlessly, its own to find.\
No earthly bounds can hold it back,\
Soaring high, with no set track.

Yet, the cloud is not without its care,\
Wholly at the mercy of the air.\
Tossed and turned, no will of its own,\
At the wind's command, it is blown.

One day, the cloud spies the distant sea,\
And realizes its true identity.\
From water it was born, to water it will return,\
This eternal cycle, it cannot spurn.\
At this moment he peers down:

A lonely sail is flashing white\
Amdist the blue mist of the sea!...\
What does it seek in foreign lands?\
What did it leave behind at home?..

Waves heave, wind whistles,\
The mast, it bends and creaks...\
Alas, it seeks not happiness\
Nor happiness does it escape!

Below, a current azure bright,\
Above, a golden ray of sun...

Two screens emitting light,\
Afront them a prodigal sits.\
Outside the window the cloud soars,\
The tale of the sail
many times crossed his ears.\
And the frog--\
in the prodigal's heart he dwells.

The prodigal dreams:\
of glorious empires that stooed the test of time,\
of taking a trip to survey the stars,\
of exploring the secrets of nature and life,\
of becoming someone worthwhile becoming.

The prodigal lives:\
through the ups and downs life has to give,\
life of the commonfolk immersed everyday,\
sometimes joy, and other times sorrow.

The prodigal sighs:\
have my dreams become ablaze?\
I am meek, without courage,\
faltered my goals for education,\
and, oh, she whom I tenderly love,\
from her I have only faced rejection.

So the prodigal weeps,
broken down he cries:\
What have I done to deserve this,\
if God created me for greatness,\
where is his faithfulness?

Distraut the prodigal proceeds,\
Heart broken, spirit in ashes,\
when he hears voice of his father:\
"My dear son, have you been well?\
Many years for you I searched--to no avail.\
But today, I find the joy of my life,\
For you, O weary voyager, have laid your feet..."

"...In me you shall rejoice and proceed:\
In me the cave-man clasps the seer,\
And garlanded Apollo goes\
Chanting to Abrahamâ€™s deaf ear.\
In me the tiger sniffs the rose.\
Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble,\
Since there your elements assemble..."

"Now, my son, many years have you suffered.\
Many obstacles, oppression and trouble.\
But take heart, for none is futile--\
Such pain will only yield purpose,\
A change in character, a newfound identity\
through which you will live under,\
from today till forever\
a new peace, renewed dreams:

You are the frog who leaped out the well,\
the cloud who preserved his strength,\
the sail who found his purpose,\
and the prodigal who found his home.\
So take heart, for I have overcome--\
now it is time to share my wonder.

In glorious empires that stooed the test of time,\
In the voyage to survey the stars,\
In the secrets of nature and life,\
In becoming someone worthwhile becoming.\
And now, my journey has just begin.
