Let's use deepseek to build Pantry pal.

Prompted deepseek r1-05-28 for sources. 

New solution uses baidu API, but it's currentlly not working. Neet to try again.

From a design POV, the baidu dashbord is way too complicated. 

Right now it is dysfunctional, so two solutions 
1. pay API credits
2. check all boxes for all functionalities?
