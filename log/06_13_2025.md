Maybe the for the long-term planning agent, 
we can recursively call it to fill in the blanks
and provide a synchronized picture. 

The format can be simple, like the markdown template given here.

## 🎯 Priorities
1. [x] Build a planning agent
   1. [x] Use it to plan for Jonathan learning math competitions 
   2. [x] Use it to come up with a system of habits.
   3. How can I imporve it?
2. [x] Learn more about transformers and training
   1. [x] Checked out Carnegie mellon's webpage, seems like a good place to staryt
   2. [x] Also showed me how to get free compute from Google, will need to check out tomorrow
3. [x] Build a self replicating agent (started)
   1. [x] Look into possible formats 
   2. It seems like there's a bunch of ongoing research about these agents

## 📝 Notes
- **Gratitude:** 
  - Thank you for the conversation with my brother
  - Please continue to help me resist the devil
  - Thank you for the paper with Dr. Kisacanin
- **Challenges:** 
  - QML is pretty hard 
  - Self replicating agents seem very hard to implement
- **Ideas:** 
  - Planning agent seems to be working fine from the get-go 
    - Let's see how we can make it better:
    - Recursively break down into smaller plans? 
    - Integrate with Atomic habits to make a habit
    - Or design a system of habits?
  - This could be an interesting idea, what if I have a **habit-building agent**? Give me a goal, I'll return a sytem of habits. 
    - This seems to be achieved and working well
  - How can we change this into an MVP?
    - Maybe add the feature of building daily plans and habits? Gotta work on the microscopic, right?
    - What about a planner agent?
