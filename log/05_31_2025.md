Time to get building - 

Let's use deepseek to build Pantry pal.

Prompted deepseek r1-05-28 for sources. 

The solution seems to be a visual recognition model, not exactly what expected (I was just thinking of a ChatGPT wrapper). Let's check it out because why not. 

So it seems like huggingface doesn't work directly, and we'll have to use this as a mirror. As a result, R1 actually generated a Chinese version, which could also be usable. Going to just try this.

Ok, it seems like models are being downloaded. This is a good sign. 

Although I'm not sure if this is as good because the model is probably English-based.
 
Ok, so the code was able to run but nothing was detected, which means I'll need to play around. Going to try the following, in order of precedence:

1. check the list of foods, change into English (tried, failed)
2. try a new image (worked)
3. try new threshold
3. try a new architecture, maybe using openai or something similar from a frontier company. 

So the model was sucessful in detecting food items after switching to a new image. That's pretty promising. The good thing is that running the model is not really costly at all. 

Perhaps I can just use high quality images? But on the other hand, the items are not very comprehensive. There's so much more than those items alone. 

```
apple
carrot
cucumber
egg
fish
juice
lettuce
milk
onion
orange
```

And it fails to list the quantity of the items.
