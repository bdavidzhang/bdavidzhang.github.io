## **Recursion Lesson Plan (50 Minutes)**

### **Part 1: The Big Idea (10 minutes)**

#### **Slide 1: Title Page**
* **Time:** 1 minute
* **Script:** "Good morning, everyone! Welcome. Today, we're going to explore a really powerful idea in problem-solving called **recursion**. It might sound complicated, but I promise it's something you already understand on some level. Our goal today is to learn how to solve big, tricky problems by breaking them down into smaller, easier ones."

#### **Slide 2: What is Recursion?**
* **Time:** 2 minutes
* **Script:** "So, what is recursion? Have you ever seen a set of Russian Nesting Dolls? You open one up, and what's inside? A smaller, identical-looking doll. And inside that one is an even smaller one, and so on, until you get to the last tiny doll that doesn't open. This idea of a thing having a smaller version of itself inside it is the key to recursion."
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:**
    * Write the word **RECURSION** on the board.
    * Underneath it, write: **"Things inside themselves."**
    * Draw a simple sketch of nesting dolls: A big circle with a smaller circle inside, and an even smaller one inside that.

#### **Slide 3: Let's Think About This Together!**
* **Time:** 4 minutes
* **Script:**
    * (Before pause) "This 'smaller version of itself' idea is everywhere. I want you to turn to the person next to you and take just one minute to brainstorm other examples. It could be from nature, art, technology... anything."
    * (After 1-minute partner talk) "Alright, let's hear some ideas! Who has one?"
    * (Take 2-3 examples from students, affirming their ideas). "Great examples! You're already thinking recursively."
    * (Click to reveal examples) "Here are a few more. A tree branch splits into smaller branches, which look like tiny trees. Mirrors reflecting each other create an endless tunnel of smaller reflections. This is the core concept: **Recursion is when we solve a big problem by solving smaller versions of the same problem!**"
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:**
    * Jot down 1-2 good student examples on the board.
    * Circle the main definition: **Solve a big problem by solving smaller versions of the same problem.**

#### **Slide 4: Example: Counting Down from 10**
* **Time:** 3 minutes
* **Script:** "Let's make this more concrete. How would you count down from 10? The normal way is obvious: 10, 9, 8, and so on. But let's think about it recursively. The recursive rule is: First, say your number. Then, the rest of the problem is just... counting down from the *next smallest number*. So, to `countDown(10)`, you just say '10' and then run `countDown(9)`. To `countDown(9)`, you say '9' and run `countDown(8)`. You repeat this same process over and over. When do you stop? When you get to 1. That's our stopping point."
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:**
    * On the "Recursive Way" side of the slide, annotate the steps:
        * `countDown(10)` -> Say "10", then call `countDown(9)`
        * `countDown(9)` -> Say "9", then call `countDown(8)`
        * `...`
        * `countDown(1)` -> Say "1", then **STOP!**

### **Part 2: Seeing Recursion in Action (10 minutes)**

#### **Slide 5: Let's Try It: Multiplication as Repeated Addition**
* **Time:** 5 minutes
* **Script:** "This is the most important slide today, so let's focus here. We know 5 times 3 is 15. But we can define it recursively. Think about it: 5 times 3 is just `5 + (5 times 2)`. And 5 times 2 is just `5 + (5 times 1)`. And what's 5 times 1? It's just 5. That's our stopping point! Once we hit that, we can work our way back up with the answers. This shows us the two essential parts of every recursive solution."
    * (Point to the alert block) "**The Rule**, or the **Recursive Case**, is how you break it down. For us, `5x3` becomes `5 + (5x2)`.
    * "**The Stop**, or the **Base Case**, is the simplest version of the problem that you can answer directly, without any more steps. For us, `5x1` is just 5. You *always* need a base case, otherwise, you'd be breaking the problem down forever!"
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:**
    * Write **"THE TWO PARTS OF RECURSION"**
    * 1.  **BASE CASE:** (The STOP)
        * Simplest problem.
        * No more steps needed.
        * Example: `5 x 1 = 5`
    * 2.  **RECURSIVE CASE:** (The RULE)
        * Breaks problem down.
        * Calls itself with a smaller input.
        * Example: `5 x 3 = 5 + (5 x 2)`

#### **Slide 6: How Does a Computer Think Recursively?**
* **Time:** 5 minutes
* **Script:** "So how does a computer keep track of all this? Imagine it like an 'Ask and Answer Back' game.
    * To solve `4 x 2`, the computer says, 'Okay, to get the answer, I first need to solve the *smaller* problem of `4 x 1`.' It puts the `4x2` question on hold and asks a new question.
    * 'What's `4 x 1`?' Oh, that's a **base case**! The answer is just 4. No more asking needed.
    * 'Great!' Now it can answer the question it had on hold. 'Since `4 x 1` is 4, then `4 x 2` must be `4 + 4`, which is 8.'
    * It has to go all the way down to the base case, and only then can it come back up with the final answer. We're about to act this out."
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:**
    * Draw a "stack" of boxes to represent the computer's memory.
    * `Main question: 4 x 2 = 4 + ???` (Draw a box at the bottom)
    * `Sub-problem: 4 x 1 = ???` (Draw a box on top of the first one)
    * `Solve sub-problem: 4 x 1 = 4` (Write "4" in the top box, then cross it out)
    * `Finish main question: 4 x 2 = 4 + 4 = 8` (Write "8" in the bottom box, then cross it out)

### **Part 3: Activity Time! (15 minutes)**

#### **Slide 7: Activity 1: Recursive Drawing - Fractal Trees**
* **Time:** 8 minutes
* **Script:** "Alright, enough talk, let's make something! Everyone grab a piece of paper and a pen. We're going to draw a fractal tree using recursion.
    * **The Base Case (Step 1):** Just draw a single vertical line. This is our trunk.
    * **The Recursive Rule (Step 2):** At the top of *every* line you just drew, draw two smaller lines branching out.
    * (Do Step 1 and 2 on the board with them).
    * "Now, what's Step 3? We just apply the *same rule again*. At the end of the two new branches we just drew, we each draw two *even smaller* branches.
    * "Keep applying the rule a few more times. You are recursively building a tree! The base case is when you decide the lines are too small to continue."
    * (Walk around the room for 4-5 minutes while students draw). "These look amazing! Notice how a very simple rule can create something so complex and beautiful."
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:**
    * Draw the steps live on the board as you explain them, narrating each step.
    * Label **Step 1** as the **"Base"** or **"Start"**.
    * Label the rule as the **"Recursive Step"**.

#### **Slide 8: Activity 2: Human Recursion Game**
* **Time:** 7 minutes
* **Script:** "Great job! Let's put the art supplies down. Now, we're going to *become* the recursion. I need 5 volunteers to come up and form a line facing the class.
    * (Arrange volunteers). "You are the computer. I am going to give the first person a number, let's say 4. Your rule is this: Say your number out loud, then turn to the next person and give them the number that's one smaller than yours. The last person is the base case: if you get the number 1, just shout 'ONE!' and that's it."
    * (Start the game). "I give you `findTotal(4)`."
    * (Student 1: "Four!", passes 3 to Student 2)
    * (Student 2: "Three!", passes 2 to Student 3)
    * ...
    * (Student 4: "ONE!")
    * "Perfect! That was the 'going down' part. Now let's 'come back up'. Let's say the goal was to add all the numbers. Now, starting from the person who said 'ONE', pass your number back and add it to the next person's number."
    * (Student 4 gives 1 to Student 3. Student 3 says "1+2=3". Student 3 gives 3 to Student 2. Student 2 says "3+3=6". Student 2 gives 6 to Student 1. Student 1 says "6+4=10". "And we have our answer: 10! Great job, everyone, have a seat."
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:** No writing needed, the activity is the visual.

### **Part 4: Wrap Up & Why It Matters (5 minutes)**

#### **Slide 9 & 10: Recursion in Nature & Technology**
* **Time:** 3 minutes
* **Script:** (Quickly click through these two slides). "As we wrap up, I just want you to see that this isn't just a computer trick. It's a fundamental pattern. You see it in the beautiful complexity of a fern leaf or a snowflake. And it's the key to solving some of the hardest problems in technologyâ€”from finding the fastest route on Google Maps by recursively checking smaller paths, to building the realistic worlds you see in video games. The big takeaway is that recursion is a powerful tool for managing complexity."

#### **Slide 11: What Did We Learn Today?**
* **Time:** 2 minutes
* **Script:** "So, let's review. What is recursion? (Elicit student response: Solving problems with smaller versions of themselves). And what are the two parts every recursive solution absolutely must have? (Elicit responses: A base case and a recursive case). Excellent. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to try and spot one example of recursion out in the world this week.
* **Annotation/Whiteboard:**
    * Point back to the key terms you wrote earlier: **Base Case** and **Recursive Case**.

### **Part 5: Q&A (5 minutes)**

#### **Slide 12: Great Job Today!**
* **Time:** 5 minutes
* **Script:** "You all did a fantastic job today grasping a tough concept. Remember, big problems are often just a bunch of small, easy problems in disguise. What questions do you have for me about recursion?"
* **(Facilitate Q&A session).**
