This article embodies what I call "vibe writing". I fed an outline for this article into Claude Sonnet 3.7 and it wrote all paragraphs other than this one. I then went through the paragraphs and applied my style. Claude produces quality writing, but some human touch brings *eloquence*.

# How to Vibe Anything (Inspired by Vibe Coding)

In February 2025, Andrej Karpathy—the best educative AI expert, in my opinion—introduced a term that would ripple through the tech realm: "vibe coding." A term that summarizes the new approach to software development with the use of generative AI that changed the relationship between programmer and machine. "It's not really coding," Karpathy explained. "I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works."

The hottest new programming language is English. Vibe coding represents a paradigm shift in which humans describe what they want in natural language, and AI generates the actual code. The programmer becomes less a craftsperson with code and more a director with a vision. Non-programmers can now build software by focusing on the problem rather than the implementation. Vibe coding is about *discernment, preference, and aesthetic vision*.

### From Technical Skill to Discerning Taste

Traditional programming is *skill-driven*: product developemnt relies on languages and frameworks. Vibe coding is *vision-driven*, it flips this model on its head. Now, the most valuable skill isn't syntax proficiency but the ability to articulate a clear vision and recognize when something works. If you've reviewed, tested, and understood it all, that's not vibe coding. Vibe coding is shapes our relationship with creation itself. The value comes from recognizing quality and utility when you see it.

### The Art of Preference

This shift mirrors transformations happening across creative fields. Consider modern music production, where producers often work with samples and digital instruments rather than recording every sound from scratch. Or visual arts, where AI image generators can produce stunning visuals from text prompts. The common thread is clear: creation is becoming more about curation, direction, and taste than technical execution.

  25% of Y Combinator's Winter 2025 startup batch had codebases that were 95% AI-generated. These founders do not lack technical skill, but they're focused on a different kind of skill. They've learned to recognize solutions that align with their vision, to prompt effectively, and to discern what works from what doesn't.

### Vibing Beyond Code

This philosophy extends far beyond software development. We can "vibe" anything:

- **Vibe writing**: Instead of laboring over every word, describe the tone, style, and content you want, then edit and refine AI-generated drafts that resonate with your vision.
- **Vibe design**: Communicate the feeling and function you want, let AI generate options, and select what works while requesting refinements that align with your aesthetic sensibility.
- **Vibe business**: Describe the problem you want to solve and the solution you envision, let AI help you map market opportunities, and focus your energy on the strategic decisions that require human judgment.

In each case, success depends less on technical implementation skills and more on having a clear vision and the discernment to recognize when something aligns with it.

### The Aesthetics of Selection

What Karpathy and others have recognized is that there's an art to selection itself. When he says he's "fully giving in to the vibes," he's acknowledging that there's an intuitive, almost ineffable quality to recognizing when something works. Marcel Duchamp's readymades challenged the art world by proposing that the act of selection itself could be art. Curator Hans Ulrich Obrist has suggested that in an age of abundance, curation becomes increasingly important. What's new is that AI now makes this approach accessible in domains previously dominated by technical expertise.

### Conclusion: Your Vibe Defines Your Creation

The ultimate insight of vibe coding, and of "vibing anything," is that creation in the AI age becomes an expression of preference and aesthetic judgment rather than technical skill alone. The question is no longer just "Can you build it?" but "Can you recognize what works and what doesn't? Can you articulate a vision clearly enough for an AI to understand? Do you have the discernment to know when something aligns with your intention?"

In this new paradigm, your unique contribution is your distinctive sense of what works. Your vibe, in essence, becomes your signature.

As we move further into this era, those who thrive won't necessarily be those with the deepest technical knowledge, but those with the clearest vision and the most refined sense of discernment. In a world where machines can increasingly handle the execution, the uniquely human contributions of preference, judgment, and taste become the true differentiators.

The future belongs not just to those who can build, but to those who can vibe.
