## Prelude

A reflection upon my "early days" bares resemblence to the opening scences of *Oppenheimer* by Nolan--an absolute piece. Oppenheimer starts with his dreams of gravity swallowing light. My story starts with a dream of the future of humanity: space ships, flying cars, robots, aliens, and neon lights. 

I have always had the ability to concentrate on something, and to wield the force of thought onto a subject I liked. When I was a child, I dreamed of tales regarding dragons and magic, even writing several books of my own. I drew detailed maps, designed futuristic architecture, and even drafted a language called *Rufastra*. In the past two years leading to this point, though, I became absorbed in history and traditional literature. Books on Chinese and Medieval History captured the bulk of my attention, in addition to writing a novel, and playing *Stronghold Crusader*. 

But now, my attention started to shift from the past to the future: I began combining my love for history and fantasy with the affection for sci-fi from even earlier years, and thus began a newfound rhapsody. But really, it all started with a twelve-year-old's pipe dream.

Commendments were never absent in my childhood, but out of all the praises I received, the most one was "this kid talks like an adult." Of course, other said might have said "this kid smelled good," "he spoke good English,", and more recently, "this kid is too fat for his own good". I did, for a while, become quite obese, but by 2018 I was starting to maintain a healthy bodyweight (by the end of the year, I became slim like a stick). Conflicted was I, with the mind of maturity and coutour of childishness.

Several other events competed for my attention. One was graduation from primary school, which I saw as an opportunity to break loose from this current environment. Of course, there were people I would miss, but I have been quite sick of the lack-of-challenge in primary school for a long time. The other, which is related to the previous, is: where to attend middle school. Personally, I was in favor of a magnet school called *Northeast Yucai Foreign Language School*, which required a selective entrance exam. The test constituted three subjects: Chinese, English, and Math. As a native speaker of both languages, these language tests were quite a piece of cake. But math made me anxious.

Truth be told, math it self was fun, but the mundane exercises bored me out. And "doing well on a math test" was never particular rewarding. Seeing that I need improvement in testing abilities, though, I joined a class on math test preparation nad found it quite appealing. This was the first mark of a pursuit in math. 

All winter I worked on math, and by spring, I felt quite confident about the upcoming test. `

When spring rolled by, Charlie and I decided to compete in a public forum debate competition. The event was sponsored by NHSDLC and was the largest of its kind in China. The subjct was "RESOLVED: China should broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty." Prophetic in retrospect. Specifics about my arguments has long been forgotten, but much was learned regarding the issue.

--Charlie was my best friend in primary school and turned out to be the first of three influential peer-friends in my teenage years. He was intelligent, articulate, and calculated. We had similar characters and intersts. He now studies economics at Cambridge. 

Again, all these events pushed me to consider the nature of the world and reality. The lessons from history, the confluence of politics, the lore of science and technology. Departure, decisions, these things rolled in my mind day and night. This was fission. For a while I lamented the loss of tranquility, but I soon embraced it, and begain to enjoy the multitude of thoughts. Like the atoms of a chain reaction, on day, I believed, these thoughs would converge to one point. *Fission will become fusion.*

The spring months quickly flew by, and with the eternal blaze rolled in summer. Fortunatley, all things worked out as expected. Graduation went smoothly, I was admitted into the magnet school, and now, I had the remaining two months of summer to explore the world.
