Prelude 
The red dragonfly, dancing in the dusk 
Could you please recount:
The day in my childhood, find it I must
What day was such an account?

Holding a basket I walked uphill
Where the mulberries lay green as ink
Carefully, I walked back, lest it spill
Was such a day just a dream? 

Where art thou, O dragonfly
Resting on a leaf
Where art thou, O dream of mine
Resting in my heart’s sheath
Soon I will find you,
Soon

Reference: Dragonfly in the Evening, a Chinese folk song.
Intermezzo
Amid the burtalist complex,
Multicolored leaves befall; 
Treading north, a gray vortex,
And a water madrigal. 

On that purple hill I saw:
Crimson city, stained blood;
Misty morning wears her shaw,
Foam riding on flood. 

Behold, the eagle strikes high,
While the cod swims low.
At the beak’s strike–
Whose fate is foretold? 

On that hill I asked the rule of the world:
What desolation has befallen your pearl. 

Reference: Inspired by a walk on Nov 16, 2024. 
Closing 
I strove for the moon, 
Now, returning home on a dark path
The moonlight befalls my steps

Peer Gynt lived a life,
Chasing the weasel all around mulberry bush-
His troll son, now man

And now I write poetry
Neglecting the world of atoms for words 
Is it my destined duty?

Allegretto is my life’s pace 
While I intend to race it, Allegro
Largo is the maze, haste. 

Coloratura, or have you befound
Catanas praising the exalted dirt mound
Examining pound for Ezra Pound

Soap isn’t all fat
Sitting in that bathtub, words profound:
Every breath, make it new!

Understood? I do not. 
Be jolly and render another thought
Now to the Epilogue–

Epilogue
Soul tie, soul tie.
In the end, we tied.
Sole tithe, sole tithe.
Bid my all to thine.
