# testimony on environments
July 2, 2025

I need faith to overcome an environment of the status quo. My faith is not in habits nor environments.

Those who are able are capable of creating environments:
In my case, avoid electronics and prepare my Bible

Faith comes from the recording of testimonies

How to win today:

Night:
Avoid temptations, videos, screen time; cast away the spirit of laziness
Avoid anger

Morning:
You must set the tone the first thing in the morning
Everyday is different, seek Godâ€™s plan

Afternoon:
Cast away the spirit of lust; have discipline to avoid gluttony
Create your own environment
Spend your afternoon in motion
