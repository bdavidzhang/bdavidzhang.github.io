# Future of Interviews (Inspired by Roy Lee)
Coding interviews **suck** because they create **time-pressured environments** that reward **memorization over real-world engineering skills**, fail to **accurately assess a candidate's actual abilities** and  remains ***disconnected*** from actual software development.

To just throw it out here:

### **Avoid the "Memorization Trap" Entirely**  
- **Ban LeetCode**: No algorithms unless directly relevant to the role (e.g., building a compiler).  
- **Use Real Codebases**: Provide snippets from your companyâ€™s actual systems (obfuscated if necessary) for debugging/refactoring.  
- **Prioritize "Why" and "when" over "How"**: Ask candidates to explain thought process, not just output.  

### What will SWE look like in a world where AI --> 10x productivity?
If AI leads to (at least) 10x productivity, SWE roles will transform from manual coding to **vibe coding**, with engineers functioning as **conductors for AI agents** to generate, integrate, and optimize code. The focus will shift toward ** challenges** like design and alignment (between product and problem), while workflows evolve to emphasize **prototyping and systems thinking**. Engineers will spend more time **refining UX and less on code**.


The #1 skill for SWEs will be **problem solving**, and that will in most times look like **debugging**. Your may not be producing the solution yourself, but you will probably be piecing together **solutions provided by various sources**. Debugging looks less like finding code/logic errors, but more like **aligning your problem with your code**. The #2 skill is **user-centric design**, especially enhanced **communication abilities** (on text and by code) to translate technical constraints for non-technical . 


## How can we fix SWE interviews?

### Coworker >> Employee. Build & show me what you got. 
One direct result to less SWEs is a **reduced number of employees**, so the stakes for picking the right person to work with are slightly higher. As a startup-minded person, the best thing I can come up with is: build something (for example, say a potential feature for my app) and pitch it to me. 

**Vision**: Build & Pitch.

Have candidates build a feature for your product and pitch it to you, demonstrating execution and business understanding.

So here's what I have in mind: 

**Goal**: Assess real-world execution abilities and product thinking. 
**Structure**:

-   Provide a mockup or description of a potential feature for your actual product
-   Give flexible deadline. Approach me whenever you're done. 
-  Obviously the sooner the better because I would love to work with you ASAP. 

**Require**:
    -   Working implementation
    -   Design journal (prompts, iterations, rationale)
    -   Pitch it to me. Or let your AI agent do that. 

**Assessment**:
-    **agent collaboration** vs. **mindless copying**
-   Design decisions: Security and scalability
-   Business acumen: Do you understand why this feature is here (or tell me why it shouldn't be here) 

**Conversation**:
The best way to see if someone aligns with your values is to talk with that person face to face. 


### Ideas for larger companies (also works for existing employees) 


####  1.Problem-Solving Through Debugging

**Goal**: Evaluate diagnostic thinking and communication. 
**Structure**:

-   Present a broken feature from your actual product (anonymized if needed)
-   Ask candidates to:
    -   Identify and document root causes
    -   Implement fixes with clear documentation
    -   Suggest preventative measures for similar issues

 **Assessment**:
-   Thoroughness of analysis
-   Quality of documentation
-   Forward-thinking preventative suggestions

#### 2.Constraint-Based System Design

**Goal**: Test adaptability and creative problem-solving.

 **Structure**:

-   Present a realistic constraint your startup faces (limited resources, unique market needs)
-   Have candidates design a solution that:
    -   Works within your actual business constraints
    -   Considers your specific user demographics
    -   Balances immediate needs with future scalability

 **Assessment**:
-   Practical creativity
-   Understanding of business context
-   Technical feasibility within constraints


### This seems like a hassle. What is I don't have time?
