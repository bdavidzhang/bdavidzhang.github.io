    "body": "<p>This article embodies what I call \"vibe writing\". I fed an outline for this article into Claude Sonnet 3.7 and it wrote all paragraphs other than this one. I then went through the paragraphs and applied my style. Claude produces quality writing, but some human touch brings <em>eloquence</em>.</p><br><h1>How to Vibe Anything (Inspired by Vibe Coding)</h1><br><p>In February 2025, Andrej Karpathy\u2014the best educative AI expert, in my opinion\u2014introduced a term that would ripple through the tech realm: \"vibe coding.\" A term that summarizes the new approach to software development with the use of generative AI that changed the relationship between programmer and machine. \"It's not really coding,\" Karpathy explained. \"I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works.\"</p><br><p>The hottest new programming language is English. Vibe coding represents a paradigm shift in which humans describe what they want in natural language, and AI generates the actual code. The programmer becomes less a craftsperson with code and more a director with a vision. Non-programmers can now build software by focusing on the problem rather than the implementation. Vibe coding is about <em>discernment, preference, and aesthetic vision</em>.</p><br><h3>From Technical Skill to Discerning Taste</h3><br><p>Traditional programming is <em>skill-driven</em>: product developemnt relies on languages and frameworks. Vibe coding is <em>vision-driven</em>, it flips this model on its head. Now, the most valuable skill isn't syntax proficiency but the ability to articulate a clear vision and recognize when something works. If you've reviewed, tested, and understood it all, that's not vibe coding. Vibe coding is shapes our relationship with creation itself. The value comes from recognizing quality and utility when you see it.</p><br><h3>The Art of Preference</h3><br><p>This shift mirrors transformations happening across creative fields. Consider modern music production, where producers often work with samples and digital instruments rather than recording every sound from scratch. Or visual arts, where AI image generators can produce stunning visuals from text prompts. The common thread is clear: creation is becoming more about curation, direction, and taste than technical execution.</p><br><p>25% of Y Combinator's Winter 2025 startup batch had codebases that were 95% AI-generated. These founders do not lack technical skill, but they're focused on a different kind of skill. They've learned to recognize solutions that align with their vision, to prompt effectively, and to discern what works from what doesn't.</p><br><h3>Vibing Beyond Code</h3><br><p>This philosophy extends far beyond software development. We can \"vibe\" anything:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong>Vibe writing</strong>: Instead of laboring over every word, describe the tone, style, and content you want, then edit and refine AI-generated drafts that resonate with your vision.</li><br><li><strong>Vibe design</strong>: Communicate the feeling and function you want, let AI generate options, and select what works while requesting refinements that align with your aesthetic sensibility.</li><br><li><strong>Vibe business</strong>: Describe the problem you want to solve and the solution you envision, let AI help you map market opportunities, and focus your energy on the strategic decisions that require human judgment.</li><br></ul><br><p>In each case, success depends less on technical implementation skills and more on having a clear vision and the discernment to recognize when something aligns with it.</p><br><h3>The Aesthetics of Selection</h3><br><p>What Karpathy and others have recognized is that there's an art to selection itself. When he says he's \"fully giving in to the vibes,\" he's acknowledging that there's an intuitive, almost ineffable quality to recognizing when something works. Marcel Duchamp's readymades challenged the art world by proposing that the act of selection itself could be art. Curator Hans Ulrich Obrist has suggested that in an age of abundance, curation becomes increasingly important. What's new is that AI now makes this approach accessible in domains previously dominated by technical expertise.</p><br><h3>Conclusion: Your Vibe Defines Your Creation</h3><br><p>The ultimate insight of vibe coding, and of \"vibing anything,\" is that creation in the AI age becomes an expression of preference and aesthetic judgment rather than technical skill alone. The question is no longer just \"Can you build it?\" but \"Can you recognize what works and what doesn't? Can you articulate a vision clearly enough for an AI to understand? Do you have the discernment to know when something aligns with your intention?\"</p><br><p>In this new paradigm, your unique contribution is your distinctive sense of what works. Your vibe, in essence, becomes your signature.</p><br><p>As we move further into this era, those who thrive won't necessarily be those with the deepest technical knowledge, but those with the clearest vision and the most refined sense of discernment. In a world where machines can increasingly handle the execution, the uniquely human contributions of preference, judgment, and taste become the true differentiators.</p><br><p>The future belongs not just to those who can build, but to those who can vibe.</p>"

This approach works in abstract representation spaces rather than pixel-level predictions[12].</p><br><h3>Language-Enhanced World Models</h3><br><p>A novel approach called Dynalang from UC Berkeley enables reinforcement learning agents to learn world models through natural language. Rather than training agents to accomplish tasks directly, this technique trains them to predict the future by learning a world model with language instructions[13].</p><br><p>As researchers at UC Berkeley note, \"Similar to how next-token prediction allows language models to form internal representations of world knowledge, we hypothesize that predicting future representations provides a rich learning signal for agents to understand language and how it relates to the world\"[13].</p><br><h3>Multimodal Integration</h3><br><p>Current research emphasizes that effective world models must integrate multiple sensory modalities. Approaches include:<br>- Alignment methods that map different modalities to common feature spaces<br>- Fusion techniques that integrate multimodal data at different model layers<br>- Self-supervised learning on unlabeled multimodal data[12]</p><br><h2>Future Directions and Challenges</h2><br><p>Several emerging trends point to the future of world model research:</p><br><h3>Enhanced 3D Understanding</h3><br><p>Future world models will likely place greater emphasis on spatial intelligence in three-dimensional environments, particularly for robotics and autonomous vehicles. This enables more realistic simulations of complex physical interactions[14].</p><br><h3>Healthcare and Specialized Applications</h3><br><p>The application of world models to healthcare represents a promising frontier. These models can provide simulated training for surgical robots and medical devices, potentially enhancing safety and efficacy in complex procedures[14].</p><br><h3>Challenges in Causality and Reasoning</h3><br><p>A significant research challenge involves moving beyond pattern recognition to true causal reasoning. Current models still struggle with complex multi-step processes where errors can accumulate over time[appendix].</p><br><p>As noted in the research literature, achieving the kind of internal models that enable reasoning about the world in human-like ways remains an open challenge. Many researchers believe that without such internal models, AI systems can never attain human-level intelligence[2].</p><br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br><p>The research landscape for world models is expanding rapidly across both academia and industry. From autonomous driving to robotics, healthcare to virtual environments, these models are increasingly seen as essential components for the next generation of AI systems that can reason about, predict, and interact with complex environments.</p><br><p>While significant progress has been made in developing architectures like autoregressive models and JEPA, challenges remain in achieving true causal reasoning and managing the computational resources required for these complex systems. The continued convergence of language models, computer vision, and physical simulation promises to further advance the frontier of what's possible with world models.</p><br><p>As Meta's Yann LeCun observed, world models aim to capture the underlying structure and dynamics of reality, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities\u2014ultimately bringing AI closer to human-like understanding of our physical world[1].</p><br><h1>World Foundation Models: Mapping the Future of AI Simulation</h1><br><p>Before exploring the latest developments in world models research, it's important to understand that world models represent a significant frontier in artificial intelligence.

Approaches include:<br>- Alignment methods that map different modalities to common feature spaces<br>- Fusion techniques that integrate multimodal data at different model layers<br>- Self-supervised learning on unlabeled multimodal data[12]</p><br><h2>Future Directions and Challenges</h2><br><p>Several emerging trends point to the future of world model research:</p><br><h3>Enhanced 3D Understanding</h3><br><p>Future world models will likely place greater emphasis on spatial intelligence in three-dimensional environments, particularly for robotics and autonomous vehicles. This enables more realistic simulations of complex physical interactions[14].</p><br><h3>Healthcare and Specialized Applications</h3><br><p>The application of world models to healthcare represents a promising frontier. These models can provide simulated training for surgical robots and medical devices, potentially enhancing safety and efficacy in complex procedures[14].</p><br><h3>Challenges in Causality and Reasoning</h3><br><p>A significant research challenge involves moving beyond pattern recognition to true causal reasoning. Current models still struggle with complex multi-step processes where errors can accumulate over time.</p><br><p>As noted in the research literature, achieving the kind of internal models that enable reasoning about the world in human-like ways remains an open challenge. Many researchers believe that without such internal models, AI systems can never attain human-level intelligence[2].</p><br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br><p>The research landscape for world models is expanding rapidly across both academia and industry. From autonomous driving to robotics, healthcare to virtual environments, these models are increasingly seen as essential components for the next generation of AI systems that can reason about, predict, and interact with complex environments.</p><br><p>While significant progress has been made in developing architectures like autoregressive models and JEPA, challenges remain in achieving true causal reasoning and managing the computational resources required for these complex systems. The continued convergence of language models, computer vision, and physical simulation promises to further advance the frontier of what's possible with world models.</p><br><p>As Meta's Yann LeCun observed, world models aim to capture the underlying structure and dynamics of reality, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities\u2014ultimately bringing AI closer to human-like understanding of our physical world[1].</p><br><p>Citations:<br>[1] https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/world-models/<br>[2] https://aiguide.substack.com/p/llms-and-world-models-part-1<br>[3]
